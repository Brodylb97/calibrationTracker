# Improvement Plans – File Location

When generating markdown files for **improvements, proposals, analyses, or plans** (e.g. architecture improvements, UX analysis, structural analysis, safety improvements, design docs), **store them in the subdirectory:**

**`Improvement Plans/`**

- Use the existing folder at the project root: `Improvement Plans/` (with a space).
- Do not create new improvement-plan markdown files in the project root or in other ad-hoc locations.
- Examples: `Improvement Plans/ARCHITECTURE_IMPROVEMENT_PROPOSAL.md`, `Improvement Plans/UX_IMPROVEMENT_ANALYSIS.md`.

This keeps all improvement and planning documentation in one place.
